Working through the modules in [Building Microservices API in Go](https://www.oreilly.com/videos/building-microservices-api/9781805124429/) written by Ashish Juyal
 

### Examples 
I use  [Bruno](https://docs.usebruno.com/)  to run test request against the apis. The test rant have been exported for Bruno an Postman in sample-request. I am trying to keep the examples tied to the same folder dir in ./cmd/{folder}/main.go. That means to run and test use those request and run the project in the same folder structure in the cmd dir.
